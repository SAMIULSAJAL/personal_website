            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Samiul Hossain Sajal</strong>, a passionate physicist with a focus on data analysis, machine learning, and computational physics. Currently, I am pursuing my second Master's in Physics at the University of Cologne. I have research experience in various fields such as condensed matter physics, quantum mechanics, and solid-state physics, and I am looking for opportunities in data analysis, research, and physics-related roles.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p><strong>Thesis Title:</strong> "Formation and oxidation of nano transition metals in the laser ablation technique by the ReaxFF reactive force field using Molecular Dynamics in High-Performance Computers" </p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we perform Molecular Dynamics simulations on high-performance computers (HPC) to investigate the phase transitions of bulk aluminum in an aqueous environment. The high-intensity laser bombardment on aluminum leads to plasma formation on the surface, which interacts with the laser beam. We aim to observe the mechanism of phase transformation on the picosecond time scale.</p>
